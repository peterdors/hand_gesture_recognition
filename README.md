# Python script for simple hand gesture recognition. This doesn't necessarily 
# recognize if a hand is in the image or not. It is just for determining on  
# images of hands if they are holding either 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 fingers up. 

# USAGE: python main.py -i path/to/image/file

# TODO(s): 	Get gesture recognition accurate for video processing of hand 
# 			gestures.
